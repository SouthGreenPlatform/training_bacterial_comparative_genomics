Jupyter Notebook extensions are add-ons that can increase the functionality of
your notebooks. These were installed in the [setup](pre-course-setup) section for this
tutorial by including the `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions` package in the conda
environment file. You can read more about the extensions
[here](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To manage extensions go to the Jupyter dashboard in your browser and click the
**Nbextensions** tab. You should see something similar to this:

Clicking an extension in the list displays more information about it. To
enable/disable extensions simply click the checkbox next to the extension name
in the list. Some useful extensions include

- **Hide input all**, which allows you to hide all code cells with the click of
  a button.

- **Collapsible Headings**, which allows you to collapse sections below markdown
  headings to increase readability.

- **Table of Contents (2)**, which adds a table of contents to the notebook
  making navigation a lot quicker especially for long notebooks.

Feel free to peruse the list and find your own favourites! Keep in mind that
these are unofficial, community-contributed extensions and as such they come
with few, if any, guarantees.
